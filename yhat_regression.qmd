title: "Regression for Y-hat"
---

[slides](slides/lec1/lec1.pdf)

This class is about regression as a tool to approximate a conditional expectation function. From this perspective, the $\hat\beta$ estimates are only a step toward the broader purpose of regression to produce $\hat{Y}$ values that achieve this approximation well. This perspective will ultimately allow us to consider machine learning estimators beyond regression.

Some of this class relies on an ongoing project on description: [ilundberg.github.io/description](https://ilundberg.github.io/description/)
