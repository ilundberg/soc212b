title: "Scale construction"
---

**Note to readers.** More than the other pages, this page is a **work in progress.** I do not use scales much, and some issues that I raise on this page may be solved by work of which I am not yet aware! Things here could also be wrong. If you are a reader who knows about or works with scales, I'm always happy to hear your thoughts.

## A case when scales work: A truly latent causal treatment

Suppose that $A_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is a latent variable that causes $Y_i$. We can't see $A_i$ directly, but only indirect measures $X_{i1},X_{i2},X_{i3}$.

How should we estimate the causal effect of $A_i$ on $Y_i$? One way is by converting the measured variables into a scale. For example, we might define a measure $\tilde{A}_i$.

$$
\tilde{A}_i = \frac{1}{3}\left(X_{i1} + X_{i2} + X_{i3}\right)
$$

This might be especially credible if the true data generating process were a linear model, such as each measure being a standard Normal draw centered on the true latent construct value $A_i$.

$$
X_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(A_i, 1)
$$

In that case, one can show that our scale estimator has a known sampling distribution,

$$
\tilde{A}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(A_i, \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{3})
$$

under which the scale estimate equals the latent construct on average, but is estimated with some noise. The measure would be better if there were more $X$ variables providing many signals of the latent construct.

Suppose the true causal effect of $A$ on $Y$ followed a very simple linear functional form that could be well-summarized by coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which capture both a descriptive and a causal association because in this case $A\rightarrow Y$ is unconfounded.

$$
E(Y^a) = E(Y\mid A = a) = \alpha + \beta a
$$

If one estimated by OLS regression of $Y$ on $\tilde{A}$, this would produce a downwardly biased estimator for $\beta$ because of measurement error in $\tilde{A}$. Because the measurement error in this simple model is by assumption known, one could correct for that error and produce an unbiased estimator for $\beta$ despite having not measured $A$ directly. First, we can derive the estimate when regressing $Y$ on $\tilde{A}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{E}(Y\mid\tilde{A}) &= \tilde\alpha + \tilde\beta \tilde{A} \\
\hat{\tilde\beta} &= \frac{\text{Cov}(\tilde{A},Y)}{\text{Var}(\tilde{A})} \\
&= \frac{\text{E}\left(\text{Cov}(\tilde{A}, Y \mid A)\right) + \text{Cov}\left(\text{E}(\tilde{A}\mid A), \text{E}(Y\mid A)\right)}{\text{E}(\text{Var}(\tilde{A}\mid A)) + \text{Var}(\text{E}(\tilde{A}\mid A))} \\
&= \frac{
  0 + \text{Cov}(A, \alpha + \beta A)
}{
  \frac{1}{3} + \text{Var}(A)
} \\
&= \frac{
  \beta
}{
  \frac{1}{3} + 1
} \\
&= \frac{3}{4}\beta
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore one could arrive at the following strategy:

* estimate $\tilde{A}$ by the average of $X_{i1}$, $X_{i2}, $X_{i3}$.
* estimate $\hat{\tilde\beta}$ by regressing $Y$ on $\tilde{A}$
* estimate $\hat\beta = \frac{4}{3}\hat{\tilde\beta}$

In the analysis above, a few things made this simple:

* each measure $X_{ij}$ was linearly related to $A_i$
* each measure had the same mean given $A_i$ and the same conditional variance
* measures were independent given $A_i$: $X_{ij}\unicode{x2AEB} X_{ij'}\mid A_i$ for all $j$ and $j'$

Methods for factor analysis and scale construction can relax the criteria above. These are statistical issues that are solveable. A bigger reason to be skeptical about scales is as follows: what if the latent construct is not the causal force after all?

## How scales can be problematic

Suppose the causal process is more accurately represented by the DAG below: each of the $X$ variables is a cause of $Y$, rather than the latent construct. There is actually no latent construct $A$ in the world; the variable $A$ is only a statistical tool that is a deterministic aggregation of the $X$ variables. Thus $A$ actually doe snot appear in the DAG at all! What has the causal power are the $X$ variables.

This may often be the setting in which social scientists use scales. A few examples:

* Neighborhood disadvantage
     * $A$ is neighborhood disadvantage
     * $X$ variables are neighborhood-level poverty, crime, and presence of local nonprofits
     * $Y$ is children's high school completion rates
* Academic achievement
     * $A$ is academic achievement measured by GPA
     * $X$ variables are grades in math, English, science, and social studies
     * $Y$ is college enrollment
* Voting patterns in Congress
     * $A$ is a partisanship score (liberal to conservative)
     * $X$ variables are voting patterns on fiscal, social, and foreign policy issues
     * $Y$ is being re-elected

In each case, it is possible that each $X$ affects $Y$, rather than $A$ affecting $Y$. If we had enough data, it would be better to study the causal effect of each $X$ on $Y$ instead of aggregating them to a score.

### Consistency goes wrong when you aggregate

What is the potential high school completion outcome $Y^a$ for a child assigned to grow up in a neighborhood assigned to disadvantaged score $a$? If poverty and crime each affect high school completion, then it would matter how you assign that child to this score: the outcome might depend on what mix of crime and poverty together create the score $a$.

Mathematically, the consistency assumption is no longer so clear. The potential outcome if assigned to treatment value $a$ is not fully defined. It might be better to study the potential outcome $Y^{x_1,x_2,x_3}$ to be realized if assigned to a neighborhood characterized by the specific set of treatment conditions $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.

A scale may still be useful in practice: there may be too few cases to yield a precise estimate of the joint causal effects of $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$. It is possible that an estimator using the scale $Y^{\tilde{a}(x_1,x_2,x_3)}$ would actually be closer to $Y^{x_1,x_2,x_3}$ than an estimator that studies the full joint causal effects. This may be an open question.

What is relevant is that when using a scale, one ought to be transparent about the assumed model of the world and why the scale is useful.

## Pros and cons

To recap, scales come with some pros and cons:

* Pros
     * simpler to study one scale than many causal inputs
     * fewer causal estimates to report
     * possible gains in statistical precision
* Cons
     * loss of concreteness: you can ask a policymaker to reduce poverty, but it is hard to ask a policymaker to intervene to change a latent scale
     * a scale requires a model of how signals relate to the latent construct, and that model may be wrong
     * a scale may create challenges for the consistency assumption

If using a scale, some things you want are:

* as many signals of the latent construct as possible
* independence of your signals
* strong association between the latent construct and each signal

Much of the literature on scales focuses on these things because they are statistically tractable. But before using a scale, you should ask yourself whether a move from many concrete variables to one latent variable will improve or complicate your analysis.

<!-- Suppose that a sample of $n$ 4th-grade teachers are beginning the school year. Each teacher $i$ is very excited to meet their students, but they are also anxious: they know that the year will go better if their students remember the material from 3rd grade. Suppose that every student $j$ in classroom $i$ has a score $X_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma^2)$ for how well they recall the 3rd-grade material. The teacher would love to know the class-average score $\mu_i$, but it is not directly measured: instead, for each teacher a sample of students reports scores $X_{ij}$ on a test. For simplicity, we will assume that the test is a good measure of understanding so that the average of the scores $X_{ij}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu_i$. -->
