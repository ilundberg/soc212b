This is not a central topic of the course, but will have an appendix page since it may be relevant to student projects.\n\n## Scale for a truly latent construct\n\nSuppose that $A_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is a latent variable that causes $Y_i$. We can't see $A_i$ directly, but only indirect measures $X_{i1},X_{i2},X_{i3}$.\n\n\n```{tikz, echo = F}\n  \\begin{tikzpicture}[x = .5in, y = .25in]\n    \\node at (-3,0) {};\n    \\node at (4,0) {};\n    \\node (x1) at (-1,-1) {$X_1$};\n    \\node (x2) at (0,1.414) {$X_2$};\n    \\node (x3) at (1,-1) {$X_3$};\n    \\node (a) at (0,0) {$A$};\n    \\node (y) at (2,0) {$Y$};\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x1);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x2);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x3);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (y);\n  \\end{tikzpicture}\n```\n\n\nHow should we estimate the causal effect of $A_i$ on $Y_i$? One way is by converting the measured variables into a scale. For example, we might define a measure $\\tilde{A}_i$.\n\n$$\n\\tilde{A}_i = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(X_{i1} + X_{i2} + X_{i3}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis might be especially credible if the true data generating process were a linear model, such as each measure being a standard Normal draw centered on the true latent construct value $A_i$.\n\n$$\nX_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(A_i, 1)\n$$\n\nIn that case, one can show that our scale estimator has a known sampling distribution,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{A}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(A_i, \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{3})\n$$\n\nunder which the scale estimate equals the latent construct on average, but is estimated with some noise. The measure would be better if there were more $X$ variables providing many signals of the latent construct.\n\nSuppose the true causal effect of $A$ on $Y$ followed a very simple linear functional form that could be well-summarized by coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which capture both a descriptive and a causal association because in this case $A\\rightarrow Y$ is unconfounded.\n\n$$\nE(Y^a) = E(Y\\mid A = a) = \\alpha + \\beta a\n$$\n\nIf one estimated by OLS regression of $Y$ on $\\tilde{A}$, this would produce a downwardly biased estimator for $\\beta$ because of measurement error in $\\tilde{A}$. Because the measurement error in this simple model is by assumption known, one could correct for that error and produce an unbiased estimator for $\\beta$ despite having not measured $A$ directly. First, we can derive the estimate when regressing $Y$ on $\\tilde{A}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{E}(Y\\mid\\tilde{A}) &= \\tilde\\alpha + \\tilde\\beta \\tilde{A} \\\\\n\\hat{\\tilde\\beta} &= \\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\tilde{A},Y)}{\\text{Var}(\\tilde{A})} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\text{E}\\left(\\text{Cov}(\\tilde{A}, Y \\mid A)\\right) + \\text{Cov}\\left(\\text{E}(\\tilde{A}\\mid A), \\text{E}(Y\\mid A)\\right)}{\\text{E}(\\text{Var}(\\tilde{A}\\mid A)) + \\text{Var}(\\text{E}(\\tilde{A}\\mid A))} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\n  0 + \\text{Cov}(A, \\alpha + \\beta A)\n}{\n  \\frac{1}{3} + \\text{Var}(A)\n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\n  \\beta\n}{\n  \\frac{1}{3} + 1\n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{4}\\beta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTherefore one could arrive at the following strategy:\n\n* estimate $\\tilde{A}$ by the average of $X_{i1}$, $X_{i2}, $X_{i3}$.\n* estimate $\\hat{\\tilde\\beta}$ by regressing $Y$ on $\\tilde{A}$\n* estimate $\\hat\\beta = \\frac{4}{3}\\hat{\\tilde\\beta}$\n\nIn the analysis above, a few things made this simple:\n\n* each measure $X_{ij}$ was linearly related to $A_i$\n* each measure had the same mean given $A_i$ and the same conditional variance\n* measures were independent given $A_i$: $X_{ij}\\unicode{x2AEB} X_{ij'}\\mid A_i$ for all $j$ and $j'$\n\nMethods for factor analysis and scale construction can relax the criteria above. These are statistical issues that are solveable. A bigger reason to be skeptical about scales is as follows: what if the latent construct is not the causal force after all?\n\n## How scales can be problematic\n\nSuppose the causal process is more accurately represented by the DAG below: each of the $X$ variables is a cause of $Y$, rather than the latent construct.\n\n\n```{tikz, echo = F}\n  \\begin{tikzpicture}[x = .5in, y = .25in]\n    \\node at (-3,0) {};\n    \\node at (4,0) {};\n    \\node (x1) at (-1,-1) {$X_1$};\n    \\node (x2) at (0,1.414) {$X_2$};\n    \\node (x3) at (1,-1) {$X_3$};\n    \\node (a) at (0,0) {$A$};\n    \\node (y) at (2,0) {$Y$};\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x1);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x2);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x3);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (x1) to[bend right] (y);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (x2) -- (y);\n    \\draw[->, thick] (x3) -- (y);\n  \\end{tikzpicture}\n```\n\n\nThis may often be the setting in which social scientists use scales. A few examples:\n\n* Neighborhood disadvantage\n     * $A$ is neighborhood disadvantage\n     * $X$ variables are neighborhood-level poverty, crime, and presence of local nonprofits\n     * $Y$ is children's high school completion rates\n* Academic achievement\n     * $A$ is academic achievement measured by GPA\n     * $X$ variables are grades in math, English, science, and social studies\n     * $Y$ is college enrollment\n* Voting patterns in Congress\n     * $A$ is a partisanship score (liberal to conservative)\n     * $X$ variables are voting patterns on fiscal, social, and foreign policy issues\n     * $Y$ is being re-elected\n\nIn each case, it is possible that each $X$ affects $Y$, rather than $A$ affecting $Y$. If we had enough data, it would be better to study the causal effect of each $X$ on $Y$ instead of aggregating them to a score.\n\n### Consistency goes wrong when you aggregate\n\nWhat is the potential high school completion outcome $Y^a$ for a child assigned to grow up in a neighborhood assigned to disadvantaged score $a$? If poverty and crime each affect high school completion, then it would matter how you assign that child to this score: the outcome might depend on what mix of crime and poverty together create the score $a$.\n\nMathematically, the consistency assumption is no longer so clear. The potential outcome if assigned to treatment value $a$ is not fully defined. It might be better to study the potential outcome $Y^{x_1,x_2,x_3}$ to be realized if assigned to a neighborhood characterized by the specific set of treatment conditions $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_$$.\n\nA scale may still be useful in practice: there may be too few cases to yield a precise estimate of the joint causal effects of $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$. It is possible that an estimator using the scale $Y^{\\tilde{a}(x_1,x_2,x_3)}$ would actually be closer to $Y^{x_1,x_2,x_3}$ than an estimator that studies the full joint causal effects. This may be an open question.\n\nWhat is relevant is that when using a scale, one ought to be transparent about the assumed model of the world and why the scale is useful.\n\n## Pros and cons\n\nTo recap, scales come with some pros and cons:\n\n* Pros\n     * simpler to study one scale than many causal inputs\n     * fewer causal estimates to report\n     * possible gains in statistical precision\n* Cons\n     * loss of concreteness: you can ask a policymaker to reduce poverty, but it is hard to ask a policymaker to intervene to change a latent scale\n     * a scale requires a model of how signals relate to the latent construct, and that model may be wrong\n     * a scale may create challenges for the consistency assumption\n\nIf using a scale, some things you want are:\n\n* as many signals of the latent construct as possible\n* independence of your signals\n* strong association between the latent construct and each signal\n\nMuch of the literature on scales focuses on these things because they are statistically tractable. But before using a scale, you should ask yourself whether a move from many concrete variables to one latent variable will improve or complicate your analysis.\n\n<!-- Suppose that a sample of $n$ 4th-grade teachers are beginning the school year. Each teacher $i$ is very excited to meet their students, but they are also anxious: they know that the year will go better if their students remember the material from 3rd grade. Suppose that every student $j$ in classroom $i$ has a score $X_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i,\\sigma^2)$ for how well they recall the 3rd-grade material. The teacher would love to know the class-average score $\\mu_i$, but it is not directly measured: instead, for each teacher a sample of students reports scores $X_{ij}$ on a test. For simplicity, we will assume that the test is a good measure of understanding so that the average of the scores $X_{ij}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\\mu_i$. -->\n\n",
