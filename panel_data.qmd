title: "Panel data"

> Here are [slides](slides/lec5/panel_data.pdf) for today.

This session will cover a series of estimators that apply when

* many units are observed over many time periods each
* one or more units become treated at some point in the observation window

These estimators include difference in difference, interrupted time series, regression discontinuity, and synthetic control. In order to cover many estimators, today's class will focus more on conceptual ideas than on coding. Thus, material is currently available in slide form rather than in written note form.
