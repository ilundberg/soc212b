title: "Statistical Uncertainty: Bootstrap and Beyond"
---

As researchers adopt algorithmic estimation methods for which analytical standard errors do not exist, methods to produce standard errors by resampling become all the more important. We will discuss the bootstrap for simple random samples and extensions to allow resampling-based standard error estimates in complex survey samples.
