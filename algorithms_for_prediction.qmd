title: "Algorithms for prediction"
---

For two sessions, we will cover a few algorithms for prediction. We aim to

* draw connections between algorithms often viewed as classical statistics (e.g., multilevel models) and those often viewed as machine learning (e.g., penalized regression)
* by learning a few new methods, become comfortable with the skills to read about additional new methods on your own in the future

## Penalized regression

## Multilevel models

## Trees

## Forests

## Gradient boosting
