    "text": "Welcome to UCLA SOCIOL 212B (Winter 2025)! See the syllabus.\nThis course is about answering social science questions using quantitative data. We will especially focus on how computational power is transforming the ways we can carry out quantitative research, covering both statistical and machine learning tools from the perspective of social science applications. The course especially emphasizes how to translate social science theories into quantities that can be estimated by algorithms designed for prediction. We will consider prediction in the service of both description and causal inference, building on ideas from SOCIOL 212A. The end product of the course is an extended abstract containing data analysis using the ideas from the course. For students continuing to 212C, the abstract can serve as the basis for the research project in that course. Students will leave the course prepared to connect social science theories to empirical evidence that can be produced by algorithms designed for prediction.",
